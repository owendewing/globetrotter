Project Proposal Feedback
Project: Globetrotter
=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
   Good job on the proposal document.  You have described what you want to
   do and why you have made some of the preliminary design decisions that
   are mentioned.  Your justification section is good too, since you mention
   the challenge of taking on integration of some new technologies with
   which you are not as familiar.

Proposal Presentation [3 points]:
   Your proposal presentation was great.  I like the graphics you selected,
   and your layout is nice and clean.  Mixing up the background color is a
   nice idea, too.

   You mention filtering the results, but I don't actually see that in your
   proposal document.  Maybe I missed it....

Summary:
--------
Total:  5% out of 5% for this deliverable.

Nice job overall!  Great start to the semester so keep it up!
