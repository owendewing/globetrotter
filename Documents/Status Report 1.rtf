Written Status Report 1\
\
I am enjoying my project so far and am excited about developing it. I have not started coding anything, but have taken this time to decide the structure of my project and what will be stored in the database versus what won\'92t. I have also spent time learning about the OpenAI API and Google Maps API documentations to get used to using these APIs.\
\
I have also taken this time to thing about what the user interface will look like and am starting to plan it out on Figma. \
\
I want to finish my Figma layout by the end of Spring Break and start coding before the next status report.}
