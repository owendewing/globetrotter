=======================================

COMPONENT BREAKDOWN:
   Not required for this semester's exercise

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
   These are excellent!  The way you broke the software into CSC's is perfect
   for your project.  The only thing I would add is try to think to the next
   layer of granularity, meaning you'll need a few more requirements in each
   section.  You are VERY close, though.

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
   These are excellent!  Good job on this section, nothing else needed.

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS:
   These are find, too.  Good job on this section, nothing else needed.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:

   Subtotal                          10/10

   Total Percentage:   10/10 = 100% which is an A-plus

Great job!
