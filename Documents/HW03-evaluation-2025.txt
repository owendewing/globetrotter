Your score: 49 out of 50 = 98% which is an A-plus

Comments/feedback:

problems 7-4 and 7-5, your answers are a bit brief.  I see what you're saying
but it would be clearer with a longer explanation and more code, or specify
where the error handling should go, the caller or the called function.

problem 8-1, EXCELLENT!

Nice work on this.  You earned 98% of 11 extra credit points!
