Written Status Report 5\
\
Since my last report, I have created my poster and ABCDR presentation slides. I have also created an icon for my app that I put on the poster. \
\
Within the app, I have made a few changes, such as improving the UI by adding icons (from Ionicon library), getting rid of the \'93Weather\'94 option in the preferences form (redundant), and implementing a value for the temperature slider, so that it gets included in the OpenAI prompt. }
