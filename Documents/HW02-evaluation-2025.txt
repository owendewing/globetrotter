Comments:
---------

problem 6-2 you need a couple more classes.  The drawable class should be
   extended to a 'LineDrawable' class, which should be extended to a 'Line'
   class and a 'Fillable' class.  The 'Text' class should be a direct sub-
   class of 'Drawable'.  The other classes should extend 'Fillable'.

Excellent work ~ keep it up!
