Written Status Report 4\
\
I have made a lot of progress since my last status report. I have completed my authentication process, including adding users to the user database once they create an account. I have also added the UI for the user home and profile pages. The profile page has the Wishlist feature; however, it is not fully functioning with the backend yet. With the home page, I created the travel preferences form, and it is successfully generating itineraries based on the queries that I am feeding to the openAI API. It is not in the format that I want yet, but I am getting output to the frontend.}
